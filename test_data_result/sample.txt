One day, a dog stole a piece of meat from a butcher’s shop and ran away. While crossing the river on the way back, he looked down into the water. There he saw his own reflection and thought it was another dog carrying meat. He became greedy and thought, “If I could snatch that meat too, I would have even more.” Thinking this, he opened his mouth to bark, and the piece of meat in his mouth fell into the river. In this way, the greedy dog lost the meat he had.
